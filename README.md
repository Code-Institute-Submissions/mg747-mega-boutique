    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Institute black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Helvetica and Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The Images used across the site and in cards were designed to be striking and to catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
